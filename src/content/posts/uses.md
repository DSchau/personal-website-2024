Inspired by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses) figured I'd share my stack.

I develop on macOS, and have for years. I find the unix-y environment, the build quality, and the wide selection of excellent software unmatched.

## Development

I used to be big on SublimeText (and before that, TextMate!), but the rise of VSCode and the excellent ecosystem of extensions has made it hard to use anything else.

- Visual Studio Code has been my editor for the past few years
- Dracula Pro is my theme
- Fira Code is my font

I recently tried out a great terminal called Warp, and I've been using that daily since late 2023. I quite like it!

As far as web browsing, I've found Arc to be great for not just daily browsing, but also for debugging since it's built on Chromium the development tools are just as good as they are in Chrome.

I spent quite a bit of time building up my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/dschau/dotfiles) and with every new Mac I spend a little time making sure it's still easy to use and seamless.
