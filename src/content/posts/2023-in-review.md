2023 was a bang-up year for the Schau household and for me, personally. First and foremost, we actually became a household. Meaning: we bought our first house and are no longer renting, and we grew our family to three with the birth of my son in February 2023.

Those two accomplishments have dwarfed all others in 2023. But, I'll still jot down a few notes of what I accomplished, what I learned, and what I hope to do even better in 2024.

## What I accomplished

- Became a dad with the arrival of Noah on February 10th, 2023
- Bought a house in San Francisco in September 2023
- My startup, Gatsby, was [acquired by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/press/netlify-acquires-gatsby-inc-to-accelerate-adoption-of-composable-web-architectures/) in February 2023 (yes, February was a little bit stressful)
- While at Netlify, we launched [Netlify Connect](https://www.netlify.com/platform/connect/), which is Gatsby's data layer made framework agnostic and available on Netlify's platform
- Chose a new job as Head of API Client at Postman in October 2023 (more on that... soon)
- [Went on Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/show/631/supper-club-why-netlify-bought-gatsby-graphql-data-layer-and-headless-cms-with-dustin-schau) to talk about the Gatsby acquisition
- [Read 25 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/41049652)

## What I learned

- **Being a parent is relentlessly difficult.** The challenge isn't the individual moments or any particular moment being exceptionally hard, it's the fact that you're _always_ a parent and you always need to be on.
- **Focus on relationships.** With a child, it's ever more important to keep focusing on relationships, both with my wife Maggie and with friends and family. It's easy to get consumed by the new life, but it's important to remember: I was me before Noah, and I need to be me with Noah too.
- **In an acquisition, seek clarity and tough decisions on why you're acquired.** One of the mistakes I made with Gatsby was not being more decisive on the acquisition strategy, which led to confusion about the framework and Gatsby Cloud strategy when the focus was on the data layer.

## What am I hoping for in 2024?

2023 was a great year, and I achieved many of my long-term goals in being a parent and buying a house. I thought there'd be this moment of satisfaction and zen in doing so, but I still feel a hunger and a desire to be better.

So 2024 is about being better. I want to be a better partner to my wife, Maggie. I want to be a better, more active parent to my son, Noah. And I want to absolutely thrive in my new, exciting role as Head of API Client at Postman. How will I measure that? That's for me to figure out.

Until next year ✌️
