My name is Dustin Schau, and my current role at Postman is Head of API Client. I joined Postman in October of 2023. What matters is what I do now, but before Postman I was co-founder and VP of Product & Engineering at Gatsby and before that a software engineer as a consultant and at Fortune 500 companies. As Head of API Client, my role is to ensure that the core engine of Postman in API Client (sending, debugging, and testing requests across multiple protocols) continues to improve.

Personally, I am a new, first-time dad and lucky husband to my wife Maggie. I live in San Francisco, CA but am from the middle of America (Iowa!) and moved to the Bay Area in 2019. In my spare time, I like to spend time with my family exploring local parks, neighborhoods, and coffee shops. I like to read (recent favorites have been the Red Rising series, as well as Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow), explore new restaurants in San Francisco and in the world, and golf when I can although less than I used to with the little one.
